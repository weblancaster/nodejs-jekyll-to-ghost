I'm going to start saying that the conference was amazing. The organization was incredibly great. The topic that each speaker spoke was very enjoyable and knowledgeable. <br>
There was attendees from 4 different countries and at least 3 speakers were foreign as well known companies like Liferay, Github, Opera, Globo.com, Avenue Code and more.

The talks were from "`UI testing frameworks`" "`Node.js`" "`UX on Google Glass`" "`Workflow for designers and developers`" "`Polifylls`" "`augmented reality on the Web`" to more client-side/Javascript related topics.

### My talk

<br>
The title of my talk is/was `Beyond the Web` where I exploited the difficulties of a Web developer on build native Apps for desktop or mobile (the talk was focused on desktop) and showed how this is easily possible nowadays with many App runtimes like Nodewebkit.

I was a bit nervous but I was more excited to present a nice content to the attendees and show them new possibilities therefore I was prepared and happy to be there speaking about that topic to a such good crowd of people wanting to learn new things.

I had a wonderful experience. Now. I hope do more talks. <br>
Cheers!
