title: Experience Chicago through Instagram

excerpt: Since the amount (just a few) of people sharing pictures on Instagram with Lollapalooza hashtag isn't the same as when the event was happening I decided to create Chicagogram.us with the hashtag #chicago #chicagogram therefore lots of people sharing different pictures of Chicago and selfies of course...

Since the amount (just a few) of people sharing pictures on Instagram with Lollapalooza hashtag isn't the same as when the event was happening I decided to create <a href="http://chicagogram.us" target=""_blank title="Chicagogram.us - Experience Chicago through Instagram">Chicagogram.us</a> with the hashtag #chicago #chicagogram therefore lots of people sharing different pictures of Chicago and selfies of course.

I'm using the same code (I did some code refactor) and changed/removed some stuff from the layout as a developer standpoint.

Enjoy!
