Last night I decided to release as beta version for Developer a project I have been working in the last week and make available as Open Source.

## Intro..

Three years ago I started work as a developer and one of the things I have been using since then is <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com" target="_blank" title="Soundcloud">Soundcloud</a> I used to use their desktop application till the day they stopped support it. to know more about it <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2011/01/06/desktop/" target="_blank" title="Soundcloud desktop support">here</a>.

Turns out that I miss my native shortcuts while listening to Soundcloud on the web browser.. Therefore I decided to solve my problem but also release as open source so contributors can suggest "new" features.. and here it is.

## Soundnode App

<a href="http://www.soundnodeapp.com" target="_blank" title="Soundnode App - Soundcloud for desktop">Soundnode App</a> is a open source project to support Soundcloud for desktop (Windows/Mac) built with Node-Webkit, Node.js Angular.js and consuming Soundcloud API.

## Why beta Developer release

I built the core but I have been working on other projects in parallel and I still want to release Soundnode App as fast as I can to the public so I thought that the community would help to get this project going faster than one man.

The project is on the Github <a href="https://github.com/Soundnode/soundnode-app" target="_blank" title="Soundnode App - Soundcloud for desktop">Soundnode App</a>.
Constructive (or not) feedback is always welcome.

Cheers!
