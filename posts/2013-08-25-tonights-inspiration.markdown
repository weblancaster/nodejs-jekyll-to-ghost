## Love and Life

Love. Perhaps just a word for some but at the same time very powerful. Love drives us to different things in life. Good things and bad things. Both..So many perspectives from different cultures and races but same origin. Your inside.

Love inspire me in some many different ways and I'm not ashamed to say I believe in true love.
And here it's very interesting to see some ways people want to express love.

You decide which one suits you.
