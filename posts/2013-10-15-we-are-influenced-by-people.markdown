It's about questioning what surround us to try understand things. The pragmatic programmer is a book that I'm looking forward to read after finish Javascript Web Applications..but for now this is what I would like to share related to the topic of this book.

<strong>"You’re a Pragmatic Programmer. You aren’t wedded to any particular technology, but you have a broad enough background in the science, and your experience with practical projects allows you to choose good solutions in particular situations. Theory and practice combine to make you strong. You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment. And you do this continuously as the work progresses. Pragmatic Programmers get the job done, and do it well."</strong>
